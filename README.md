# EECS-Waitlist-Dashboard

CS classes at UMich are notorious for filling up within the first couple registration dates. This dashboard is for helping you make an informed decision about which classes to register for. All upper-level EECS classes are shown along with their waitlist status, if a class is waitlisted it will also display how many people are on the waitlist. There is also easy Atlas access with links for each class to learn more.
